The beds were incredibly comfy with soft sheets and clean mosquito nets (a rare thing in Bali!). \\n\\nThe restaurant nearby served delicious food at reasonable prices, and it could be brought right to the house, which was wonderful when it was raining! \\n\\nIf you're looking for a very quiet, serene place to chill out for a few days, this is it! \",\n",

Open layout top floor is just stunning. Anybody into architecture must see this place. Staff is amazing as is the food, can't thank Yustina and Mirna enough and all the staff we encountered, mucb more like a hotel, meals delivered to your home and housekeeping. Fair warning though, there is not a single window in the home, so nature may come with the territory. There are curtains around the beds so u can sleep inside in safety from bugs/birds should they bother u, and ac in the one bedroom on the bottom floor (where we slept). I would imagine it may get a bit hot in the others. But this shouldn't put u off, this place is ridiculous and def worth a couple nights, bring your gopro/super wide angle camera and your videos will make prove it... we would love to come back in the future!

    "      \"comments\": \"Our family of 4 from HK was seeking an exceptional, natural, unplugged holiday during Xmas & the Green Village definitely offered us more than what we expected!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sunrise House is a fantastic architecture and a perfect home away from home for us to wind down, read, write & enjoy intimate moments with our kids. We never had such a large lodging for holidays and best was the rent!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat exceeded most our expectation was the friendliness of all the staff there. Special thanks to Yusiana (our Villa Manager), Mirna & our driver Budi! First, I found my passport lost right after I checked in the Village and it was Mirna who kept being very positive & helpful in calming me down & checking things for me. Next day Yusiana & Budi drove me to the airport where they made some arrangement and got me back in the security checkpoint where I forgot to take my passport! I can't express more my thankfulness to them, not to mention the courtesy that they didn't charge me this transportation!\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout our stay we felt we were so nicely taken care of! Mirna even spent hours to help my girl untangled her hair that was stuck in a comb; and Yusiana kept trying to secure tours for us at different other places (Green School, John Hardy Jewellery Factory) where we felt we got extra privilege only cos we were guests from the Green Village (private tour by the best guides - same fee!)\\r\\n\\r\\nBack to the house. The 1-foot long gekko, bugs and moths actually didn't 'bug' us a lot as we chose to experience this windowless bamboo house. It could have been better only if their breakfast can be improved...actually the first dinner there was delicious but the breakfast was a bit substandard (scramble eggs were tasteless and there's no option of fried eggs; pancake & french toast were rock hard). We did buy bread for ourselves (there's toaster) but once we finished it isn't on the menu (so we were basically fixing cereal & fruit everyday).\\r\\n\\r\\nI understand that not everyone can tolerate a windowless, air-con-less lodging in a warm place like Bali, but this experience definitely was one of the most memorable (and best) we had! We actually felt grateful that it didn't take long for all 4 of us to adjust to a '100% natural' setting, that we came to live with the insects as a visitor, and adapt to their habitat in the most stylish, luxurious way!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe'd love to come back again, probably for summer Green Camps! Thank you once again for your hospitality!\",\n",

The space was gorgeous and unlike any architecture I've ever seen. My favorite was the television nook since it was the perfect little space that was a bit more closed off from the other open parts of the space. But the whole place felt so luxurious, yet unique. I definitely wish we stayed longer! \\n\\nOpen air naturally called for a good number of passing by insects and animals (cats!). The worst was flying insects right around sunset, but that's to be expected. Just be aware if you're booking. \\n\\nThe customer service was amazing with our host assisting us with every need we had, including planning meals and a driver to and from our other locations. \\n\\nI wish I had looked more into the tour of the Green School. For some reason, I was under assumption that we would just be able to walk there and tour ourselves, but that's certainly not the case! Take advantage ahead of time! But we were still able to venture the neighborhood surrounding and the river/jungle area which made for a relaxing getaway. Highly recommended!\",\n",

You do feel like you are in this amazing jungle tree house overlooking the vast tropical rain forest. Everything is indeed very open including the bathroom facilities. So be prepared for some openness amongst the people staying in the house. Since there are no sealed walls, you expect there to be a variety of bug life that come in, especially at night when you have the lights on. But they are not a nuisance at any point. There are heavy duty insect netting around all the beds giving you a very cosy bubble to be in. The mosquitos were not as prevalent as we would have expected, maybe because the house is quite elevated. The generous airflow also means we are just comfortable, and was never in need for air con. Although the river flowing noise is quite loud at nights, it is actually quite relaxing. The place is in it's own guarded development, as it is quite remote. The staff on sight were all super friendly and super helpful. So thanks. We chose to stay here specifically to enjoy the house (& the village), and also to visit the Green School and Bamboo factory. So a perfect for what we were looking for.\",\n",

Upon arrival, the management team arranged transportation from the airport to the Green Village which was quite appreciated as the place is hard to find.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were taken away by the architecture of the house and the whole village as well. Almost every bit is made out of bamboo. \\r\\n\\r\\nSince it's situated in the middle of a forest, we saw few unharmful insects and birds inside, but this was expected and we did not mind it. They seem to go back to the forest after midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nStaying in Green Village was defiantly the highlight of our Indonesia trip. It's not a mere accommodation, but a unique experience that I will definitely repeat if I go to Bali again. Highly recommended. \\r\\n\",\n",
